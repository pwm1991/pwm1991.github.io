## Background

### {{% icon-link text="Digital Analytics Lead, Charlotte Tilbury" link="https://www.charlottetlbury.com" %}}

{{< subtitle text="September 2020 - Present">}}

I work on data products at Charlotte Tilbury with a focus on product analytics and martech. I lead a squad of data engineers and product analysts who build data models and deliver insights to a wide range of stakeholders, including product, performance marketing, CRM and customer insights. My squad is also responsible for data collection and privacy across Google Tag Manager (Server), Appsflyer, and off-device measurement.

My highlight has been migrating away from Google Analytics to Snowplow, a headless open-source analytics platform, to measure product performance and customer behaviour.

I mainly work on Google Cloud Platform and use BigQuery, Dataform, Looker, Snowplow and Appsflyer.
