## Background

### {{< icon-link text="Digital Analytics Lead, Charlotte Tilbury" link="https://www.charlottetilbury.com">}}

{{< subtitle text="September 2020 - Present">}}

I work on data products at Charlotte Tilbury with a focus on product analytics and martech. I lead a squad of data engineers and product analysts who build data models and deliver insights to a wide range of stakeholders, including product, performance marketing, CRM and customer insights.

I led the migration away from Google Analytics to Snowplow, a fully in-house set of data models to measure product performance and customer behaviour.

At Cancer Research I refactored their tracking and martech data stack to improve the performance and realibility of their data collection. I also rolled out OneTrust across their digital estate to comply with privacy regulations.
