This is my first attempt at making baguettes. I've been making loaves for over  a year now but I've not really branched out into other types of bread. For New Year's Eve, I thought I'd change that.

The recipe is pretty simple:

**8pm - make a poolish**

-   180g flour
-   100% water @ 18{{< celcius >}} (as a percent of the flour)
-   0.2% yeast

Leave overnight for 12-14 hours until it smells ripe.

**9am - create the main**

-   300g flour
-   56% water @ 18{{< celcius >}}
-   2% yeast
-   4% salt

This creates a high hydration dough (~70%) that should lead to some nice airy bread at the end.

Mix the dry ingredients together first and add the water to the poolish. Then put the poolish and the water into the main and mix together for 5-10 minutes.

**9:30 & 10am: folding**

Over the next hour, fold the bread twice, and then leave to rise for another hour.

**12pm: shaping**

At 12pm, put the pizza stone in the oven and set it to 230{{< celcius >}}. Put an empty water pan in the oven as well, for steam. (Avoid using ceramic for this - I cracked mine)

At the same time, start shaping your bread for the final rise. I have no idea how to shape baguettes, but I know what they look like, so I went about shaping them into flat logs and tucking them into a bread couche.

**1pm: baking**

Before transferring to the oven, score the loaf multiple times diagonally using a bread lame or knife - 1cm deep is fine. When the bread goes on the stone, add boiling water to the pan and shut the door quickly: this will create steam and a crusty exterior.

Leave for about 15-20 minutes. I'd err on the lower side at first; each of my three attempts went in for too long and ended up with not-quite-burnt crust in places that was a bit too hard to bite into. But otherwise, baguettes!
