I&amp;rsquo;ve been making loaves for over a year now but I&amp;rsquo;ve not really branched out into other types of bread. For New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d change that.
First, second and third attempts.

8pm - make a poolish
180g flour 100% water @ 18Â°C (as a percent of the flour) 0.2% yeast Leave overnight for 12-14 hours until it smells ripe.</description></item><item><title>Olive</title><link>https://www.pwm1991.com/blog/olive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2021 20:16:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pwm1991.com/blog/olive/</guid><description>Olive is a miniature poodle who, as of June 2021, is about a year old.
