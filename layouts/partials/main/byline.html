    Hi, I'm Pete. I live in London with my wife Amy and
    <a href="/olive/">Olive the Poodle</a>.
</p>

<p>
    In August 2024 I moved to Depop, where I'm Analytics Engineering Lead.
    Previously, I was at Charlotte Tilbury, where I acted as a technical product
    manager focusing on behavioural data.

<p>
    I enjoy gardening (allotment!), video games (Tarkov), books, castles and
    telling dad jokes.
</p>

<p>My favourite emoji is party parrot.</p>
