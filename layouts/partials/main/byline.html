    I'm an Engineering Manager working at <a href="https://www.depop.com" target="_blank">Depop</a> in data. Over the years I've enjoyed working for diverse companies like the Lib Dems, the Royal Society and Charlotte Tilbury.

    I mostly use this site to play around with stuff and occasionally write down what I'm thinking. It's certainly of no value but it's slightly cathartic.
