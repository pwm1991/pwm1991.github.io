Hi, I'm Pete. I live in London with my partner Amy and dog <a href="/blog/olive">Olive</a>. Day to day I work on digital analytics at <a class="icon-link-header" href="https://www.charlottetilbury.com" target="_blank" title="Open Charlotte Tilbury's website">Charlotte Tilbury</a>. Here I write about my bread recipes (because I can no longer read them from my recipe book) and might occasionally write about other stuff.
