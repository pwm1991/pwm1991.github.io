<p>Hi, I'm Pete. I live in London with my partner Amy and Olive the Poodle.</p>


<p>I work at <a class="link" href="https://www.charlottetilbury.com" target="_blank" title="Open Charlotte Tilbury's website">Charlotte Tilbury</a> on behavioural data.</p>

<p>I enjoy gardening (I have an allotment!), video games (Tarkov), books, castles and telling stupid jokes.</p>
